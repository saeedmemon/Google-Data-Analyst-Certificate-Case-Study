# Google-Data-Analyst-Certificate-Case-Study

In this case study the goal is to see how do annual member riders and casual riders use Cyclistics bike differently. The stakeholder wanted to find ways to attract casual riders into members and they have came to me for help.


1. First I clean and sort the date, by adding 2 columns ride length and day of the week each in the 12 excel file representing each month in the year.
2. Then format all the columns in R to prepare for the merge of data.
3. Further more cleaning by removing data with inconsistent errors, since the data size is rather large and difficult to going back to find the missing value, these will be omitted.
4. Once data is cleaned and organized we then start analysis with mean, min, max and median.
5. Further more analysis with aggregating to show the difference between memebers and causals with previous 4 function.
6. Created two plots to visualize and give inform insights to stake holders.
